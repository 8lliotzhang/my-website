                <h2>15 Jan 2026 - on the proposed reactivation of Ottawa Union Station</h2>
                <p>
                    We are building a New Canada, and we will bring rail back to Ottawa Union Station. It is a symbol of our national rejuvenation, of our rebirth, and of connection to our roots. Yes, we are a modern nation, with a diverse progressive and healthy democracy and a strong diversified economy, one quite different to the Confederation of 1871. But that shared national myth remains important to our heritage and identity when we call ourselves <b>Canadians</b>. <br><br> Ottawa, the city linking Toronto and Montreal, Ontario and Quebec, Upper and Lower Canada, will once again have a rail connection hub for all peoples in the very heart of downtown. Furthermore, such placement would be extremely convenient, within walking distance of Byward and Parliament, especially with a walking tunnel connection to the nearby Rideau LRT Line 1 station. In every category, (except for maybe environmental, I'm not sure, I haven't done the studies) the reactivation of Ottawa Union Station is clearly the best choice.
