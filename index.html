        <h1>Hi, I'm Elliot!</h1>
        <p>Hello, world! I'm a Grade 11 IB student from Ottawa, Ontario. Sometimes I build stuff and put it here.</p>
        
        <p>(Fun?) Facts:
            <ul>
                <li>I play the piano and clarinet!</li>
                <li>I started Hack Club at my school!</li>
                <li>I code and build games when I procrastinate!</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

            <h3>Bad Flight Simulator</h3>
            <p>An old, not very polished 2D flight simulator I made when I still had free time.  It exists but I'm not actually sure you can play it. Sorry!!!</p>  
            <a href = "https://relightstudio.itch.io/badflightsimulator" class="linkbutton">Check it out</a>

            <h3>Laser Lander</h3>
            <p>I made this with 2 friends at Counterspell Ottawa! The theme was "You are your own enemy". You control a lunar lander, but also must dodge the laser turret, which is controlled by your steering of the spaceship! Can you survive and land on the Moon?</p>  
            <a href = "https://kelliason.itch.io/laserlander" class="linkbutton">Play on itch.io (it's kinda loud)</a>

            <h3>Coming Soon: Verifiery</h3>
            <p>A project with Charles Zhu! We're gonna use GPT output to detect AI-generated text and hopefully reduce false accusations of students!</p>

            <h3>Coming Soon: Winglet</h3>
            <p>So basically I found a cool API that makes requests to Flightradar24 and I'm trying to see if I can make it into an app.</p>
